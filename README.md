# Japanese-language fork of Zhongwen Reader 

This is a first version of a lightweight hover dictionary plugin for Obsidian that makes it easy to read Japanese text and build your vocabulary. 

This is a fork of the original [Zhongwen Reader](https://github.com/natipt/obsidian-zhongwen-reader) developed by [natipt](https://github.com/natipt/), for Japanese-language use rather than Chinese. For more details about the use of this plugin, see the Zhongwen Reader README.

This fork is an early version. All basic functionality is present, but the design and layout of the tooltip is not yet optimized for Japanese text. 

The dictionary used at present is a Kanji-only dictionary [KANJIDIC2](http://www.edrdg.org/kanjidic/kanjd2index_legacy.html). In the future, support will be added to optionally enable a more comprehensive dictionary that includes full words and example phrases.

# ðŸ“¦ Coming soon
- [ ] Improved tooltip layout and customization for Japanese text
- [ ] Support for full word dictionary 
- [ ] Support for JLPT vocabulary lists and highlighting (in place of the currently broken HSK functionality).
